///         Owns the tax-config storage, the post-graduation timestamp, the standard `markGraduated`
///         + `getTaxConfig` overrides, the dev-supplied init plumbing and the owner-only
///         `rescueTokens` path. Variant-specific behavior (intrinsic V2 taxation, V4 pool-manager
///         pair check) lives in the concrete subclasses.

///      taxDurationSeconds, graduationTimestamp) directly after `LivoToken`'s storage. Subclasses
///      that add their own state must do so AFTER these fields to preserve clone-storage layout.
